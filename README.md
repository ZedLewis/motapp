MOT details app build for a take home test.

Built to the following requirements -

User Story
As a user running the application I want to view a vehicle MOT Expiry date if I submit a registration number (e.g. XX10ABC) So that I know when to renew the MOT for this vehicle

Acceptance criteria
Given the application prompts the user for a registration number When the user submits a valid registration number Then the make, model, colour, current MOT expiry date and Mileage at the last MOT are displayed

Given more time, I would've -
- Built some unit tests
- Built upon my error handling to create a message for invalid registrations
- Have the clear details button clear the form rather than refresh the page
